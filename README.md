# Urban_Heat-prediction-model
This repository contains notebooks used to collect and process Sentinel-2 and Landsat data to predict Urban Heat Index in New York City. A comparison was done, and Sentinel-2 outperformed Landsat with an RÂ² of 0.89 vs. 0.86. Models were stacked using Extra Trees to boost accuracy, but inference tests revealed overfitting.
